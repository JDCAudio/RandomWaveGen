# RandomWaveGen
Random Wave Gen is the temporary archive of my experimentation and development of a synthesizer based off of a randomized waveform. 

# Description of Project
I plan to design a software synthesizer which will utilize controlled randomness to generate unpredictable, morphing waveforms based off of user-set parameters. 
Faust (Functional Audio Stream) will be used for the DSP coding, and the GUI will be built in the Juce C++ Framework.
